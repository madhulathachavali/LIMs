# Install Nextflow with a single command; https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow
curl -fsSL https://get.nextflow.io | bash

Steps to Use the Nextflow Script:
1. Install Nextflow

brew install nextflow


2. Create a Nextflow Workflow
create a directory to store Nextflow script and associated files. 

bash
Copy code
mkdir ~/nextflow_workflow
cd ~/nextflow_workflow

3. Create a Nextflow Script (e.g., main.nf)
Create a file named main.nf in the directory containing your Nextflow process and workflow logic.

Open a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, or any IDE you like) and create the Nextflow script.

bash
Copy code
nano main.nf
Inside main.nf, add your Nextflow process:

groovy
Copy code
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

process analyzeGeneExpression {

    input:
    path gene_expression_data

    output:
    path "differential_expression_results.csv"

    script:
    """
    # R script for analyzing the gene expression data
    Rscript analyze_expression.R $gene_expression_data
    """
}

workflow {
    // Specify the path to your CSV file on your Mac
    gene_expression_file = "/Users/madhuchavali/Desktop/Gene_expression.csv"

    // Run the process with the provided file
    analyzeGeneExpression(gene_expression_file)
}
4. Create the R Script (e.g., analyze_expression.R)
In the same directory (~/nextflow_workflow), create the R script analyze_expression.R which will be used to analyze the gene expression data.

bash
Copy code
nano analyze_expression.R
Add your R script for differential expression analysis or any other analysis you wish to perform. For example:

r
Copy code
# R script to read gene expression data and perform differential expression analysis

# Load necessary libraries
library(DESeq2)
library(readr)
